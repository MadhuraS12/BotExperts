Home Depot workers petition to form 1st store-wide union,"NEW YORK (AP) —

Home Depot workers in Philadelphia have filed a petition with the federal labor board to form what could be the first store-wide union at the world's largest home improvement retailer.

The petition, filed with the National Labor Relations Board this week, seeks to form a collective bargaining unit for 274 employees who work in merchandising, specialty and operations. The federal agency's database shows no other attempts to form a store-wide union at the company, though a group of Home Depot drivers successfully unionized with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 2019.

Sara Gorman, a Home Depot spokesperson, said the company is aware of the filing and “we look forward to talking to our associates about their concerns.”

“While we will of course work through the NLRB process, we do not believe unionization is the best solution for our associates,” Gorman said in an email.

Vincent Quiles, a store employee who is leading the petition, said he delivered the petition with 103 workers' signatures to the federal labor board Tuesday.

He said discontent with compensation and working conditions rose as employees felt strained during the pandemic.

Quiles, who makes $19.25 an hour in the receiving department, said he and other workers felt they could have benefited more from the record profits Home Depot made during the pandemic, as demand grew for home improvement projects. He pointed to two bonuses he received last year that amounted to less than $400.

Meanwhile, Quiles said his store felt perpetually understaffed, and employees were routinely asked to work in other departments with little training, sometimes angering customers when they could not provide the expertise expected of them.

“I would see corporate visits. They would say you're doing a great job, you are so essential. You have to walk the walk. You can't just come in here and say a bunch of nice things,” Quiles said. “This is a long shot but I think we can do this. This is just the beginning.”

Home Depot, based in Atlanta, employs about 500,000 people at its 2,316 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Worker discontent has galvanized labor movements at several major companies in the U.S. in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sparked tensions over sick leave policies, scheduling, safety and other issues.

In a surprise victory, Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse voted in favor of unionizing in April, though similar efforts at other warehouses so far have been unsuccessful. At least 238 U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize over the past year, according to the NLRB. Last week, rail workers won key concessions in a tentative agreement with rail companies that averted a potentially devastating shutdown of the nation's freight trains."
Ecowas threatens tough sanctions on Guinea,"Guinea-Ecowas-Transition-Sanctions Ecowas threatens tough sanctions on Guinea

APA - Dakar (Senegal)

President Umaro Sissoco Embalo of Guinea Bissau in his capacity as chair of the West African regional bloc is threatening tough sanctions against Guinea should its military rulers stick to their 36-month transition timetable.

By Abdou Cisse

President Embalo, who holds the rotating chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) since July, asked the Guinean authorities in an interview with Radio France Internationale (Rfi) and France 24 to reduce the transition period to 24 months.

This comes 24 hours before the extraordinary summit of the Conference of Heads of State of Ecowas in New York, on the sidelines of the 77th UN General Assembly.

Reflecting the position of Ecowas, Embalo said the 36-month transition timetable set by Conakry are unacceptable.

In a thinly-veiled threat Embalo added: “If the junta maintains the three years, there will be heavy sanctions. We cannot accept that''.

After the September 5, 2021 putsch against former President Alpha Conde, Ecowas had suspended Guinea from its membership before imposing individual sanctions against the putschists.

At its ordinary session on July 3, the regional grouping maintained its position on a military junta-led Guinea.

It also appointed former Benin president Thomas Boni Yayi as Ecowas mediator for the country tasked with negotiating a transition timetable acceptable to Ecowas by August 1, 2022.

Since then, the former head of state of Benin has visited Conakry twice without success, although he welcomed the establishment of an inclusive consultation framework to facilitate the return to constitutional order during his last visit (August 21-27).

However, this is being boycotted by key opposition figures, in a context of repression of the National Front for the Defense of the Constitution (FNDC), the main architect of the campaign against Conde's third bid for the presidency.

The organization was dissolved by the ruling junta, which accused it of subversive activities, and its leaders sent to prison.

S/African court freezes pension payment for graft-accused lottery chief,"South Africa-Corruption-Lottery S/African court freezes pension payment for graft-accused lottery chief

APA-Johannesburg (South Africa)

The Special Tribunal has granted the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) a preservation order to freeze pension benefits of corruption-accused former National Lotteries Commission (NLC) chief operating officer Philemon Letwaba, APA learnt here on Thursday.

The Special Tribunal order interdicts the Liberty Group — the pension administrator — from paying out pension benefits valued at around R2.8 million (about US$160,000) that is due to Letwaba pending the outcome of investigations into the activities of the former NLC official.

The SIU sought the Special Tribunal’s intervention to freeze the pension benefits of Letwaba after he resigned from the NLC pending the institution of a disciplinary hearing into his role in the distribution of lottery funds to several non-profit organisations.

An investigation by the SIU in the affairs of NLC had revealed that Letwaba allegedly benefited personally from monies received by the organisations.

The official is alleged to have used friends and family businesses and trusts to receive money from the non-profit organisations for his personal benefit.

In one of the cases, a non-profit organisation based in Limpopo province received approximately R25 million for the refurbishment of a school that had been destroyed by fire. However, 12 days later the organisation allegedly transferred approximately R4 million to a company with links to Letwaba without evidence of work being done.

Siply Plans To Launch 1000 Phygital Branches Recruit 3 000 Employees,"The company targets to launch 200 branches in the next 12 months with an eventual aim to reach 1000 branches in the next three years

Siply, a micro-savings platform plans to launch Phygital branches across six metro cities in the next three months. Overall, Siply will launch a total of 1,000 branches across 115 cities in India and look to hire around 2,000-3,000 employees. Siply also plans to establish a strong agency network as its presence expands across the length and breadth of the country. Siply currently has a staff strength of 60 employees and is set to launch its first physical branch in September.

The platform aims to empower middle-income Indians by digitising and democratising financial services in a tech-friendly manner. Siply also makes savings ‘vernacular’ as its services are available in all regional languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telegu, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, and Oriya. .

“The strong interest by retail investors also increased the demand for micro-credit in the market, which worked in our favour. This, combined with our expansion plans, will likely facilitate the company’s growth story to become India’s leading micro-savings and investment platform,” said Chakrabarty."
Denver judge rejects GOP residency complaint against Democratic candidate in pivotal state Senate district,"A Democrat running to represent a state Senate district in a 2022 race that could determine whether Republicans reclaim some power at the Colorado Capitol next year survived a GOP challenge to his candidacy Wednesday.

After a daylong hearing that featured testimony from a private investigator and questions from two high-powered partisan attorneys, Denver District Court Judge Alex C. Myers ruled late Wednesday that state Rep. Kyle Mullica, a Democrat, did not violate a requirement that candidates for Colorado statehouse seats live in the district they are running to represent for a year before Election Day.

Mullica is running to represent Senate District 24 in a closely watched race against Republican Courtney Potter, an Adams 12 Five Star Schools board member. Until November of last year he was registered to vote at his family’s home in Northglenn, where his wife was a city council member. But on Nov. 4, 2021, he changed his voter registration to his mother’s house in Federal Heights.

Mullica says he moved in with his mother to help her manage some health and financial issues. His wife and children stayed in Northglenn.

The house in Federal Heights is in Senate District 24, a competitive district in Adams County mostly east of Interstate 25. The home in Northglenn is in Senate District 25, where incumbent state Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat, is running for reelection in November.

In April, Mullica and his family moved into a newly built home in Thornton, which is also in Senate District 24. The winner of the District 24 race could determine whether Democrats or Republicans have the majority in the Senate in 2023 and 2024.

Two District 24 voters, Rebecca Elmore and Thomas J. Scovill, filed a residency challenge against Mullica last week, claiming that Mullica hadn’t actually moved into the district last year. Elmore is an unaffiliated voter and Scovill is a Republican. The pair are represented by Suzanne Taheri, a Republican lawyer who used to be Colorado’s deputy secretary of state and often serves as the attorney for conservative political groups.

The complaint filed by Elmore and Scovill included a report from a private investigator and photographs of Mullica and his family at their Northglenn home in March.

However, the investigator, Ryan Zahn, testified Wednesday that he didn’t monitor Mullica’s whereabouts overnight and so he couldn’t say whether Mullica spent the night at the Northglenn home at the times he photographed the lawmaker and his vehicle there.

Mullica testified, under questioning from former 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler, a Republican, that he would frequently visit his family at the Northglenn home — and sometimes spend the night there — but that he always intended his residence to be his mother’s Federal Heights home after moving there in November 2021. Mullica said moving into his mom’s house was a difficult decision because it meant he couldn’t run for reelection to his House seat, but that she was facing physical and mental health challenges and was struggling with her finances.

“The Senate district lines were not a part of the conversation,” he testified, explaining that he first started discussing whether to move in with his mother in October 2021.

Mullica said when he realized he could run for the Senate District 24 seat after moving, he jumped at the opportunity. “I wanted to still have that opportunity to serve my community, so I decided to run for Senate District 24.”

Eventually, Mullica said, he and his wife, Julie, decided to move into a home in Thornton in District 24 to accommodate their growing family. She resigned from her position on the Northglenn City Council as a result.

Residency for the purposes of voting and for holding office can be difficult to define in Colorado, which has opened the door for challenges. There have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years in which politicians’ and voters’ residencies have come under scrutiny.

State law defines a person’s residence as “the principal or primary home or place of abode … in which a person’s habitation is fixed and to which that person, whenever absent, has the present intention of returning after a departure or absence, regardless of the duration of the absence.”

Myers, the judge overseeing the case, said his ruling was a “close call,” but that he found Mullica’s explanation of why he moved credible.

“It is apparent that Rep. Mullica genuinely wanted to care for his mother and moved for that purpose,” Myers wrote.

Brauchler pressed Mullica about his mother’s health, how many nights he stayed at his family’s house in Northglenn after changing his voter registration to the Federal Heights address and why Mullica didn’t change his address on his nursing license as required.

(Mullica said he intends to change the address on his nursing license in a few weeks when it’s up for renewal. He pointed out that he changed his address for his hunting and fishing license and for his mileage reimbursement for his work at the Capitol.)

Elmore and Scovill, who weren’t in court Wednesday, could appeal the decision. Taheri declined to say who is funding the residency challenge, citing attorney-client privilege.

Taheri works for several conservative political nonprofits that don’t have to disclose their donors — groups that The Colorado Sun refers to as dark-money organizations. Brauchler is the president of one of those nonprofits: Advance Colorado Academy.

Mullica is one of several state lawmakers whose residency qualifications have been questioned in recent months after last year’s once-a-decade redistricting process. Outgoing state Sen. Pete Lee, D-Colorado Springs, was indicted on a felony charge in August on suspicion of lying about his address for the purpose of voting. A Democratic dark-money group asked El Paso County prosecutors to probe whether Republican Sen. Dennis Hisey committed the same crime.

Both men have denied wrongdoing.

Questions have also been raised about the residency of Democratic state Rep. Tracey Bernett, of Boulder County, who has refused to discuss where she lives with The Sun.

Hisey and Bernett moved after the redistricting process to run for reelection this year — Hisey moved to a district that had an open seat, Bernett to one that was more favorable to Democrats."
CT’s big hospital systems are buying up private practices and small hospitals. What does that mean?,"Original reporting by Katy Golvala, Erica E. Phillips, Dave Altimari and Nicole McIsaac. Compiled by Nicole McIsaac.

Connecticut’s health care industry is becoming increasingly concentrated.

In return, some small private practices in the state are finding it difficult to compete with big health care systems. Instead of struggling to stay afloat, many are joining them.

As of January, hospitals owned 26% of physician practices nationwide, up from 14% a decade ago. An additional 27% of practices were owned by a corporation, leaving fewer than half of physician practices under independent ownership.

Connecticut is no exception. Here’s what you need to know.

Hospital mergers are changing the way people in CT receive care

In Connecticut, two systems — Yale New Haven and Hartford HealthCare — are on the brink of owning more than half the 27 hospitals in the state.

Today, the state has six independent hospitals. Only one of Connecticut’s four rural hospitals remains independent — and it’s not likely to stay that way.

While regionalizing health care services in this way can improve the bottom line for hospital systems, it leaves some patients farther away from the medical care they need.

Service cuts often follow acquisitions. The cuts have had a particularly strong impact on the state’s rural labor and delivery landscape.

Large hospital systems in CT are also acquiring private practices

Together, the state’s five health systems account for more than a quarter of the around 17,000 physicians licensed to practice in the state.

Reports filed to the Office of Health Strategy show that Hartford HealthCare has been acquiring physician practices most actively over the last several years.

Since 2015, Hartford HealthCare has acquired 14 practices and 59 doctors, according to publicly available notices of material change.

Concentrated health care services can mean higher costs

When health systems acquire hospitals and small physician practices, it has economic consequences.

Researchers have connected hospital consolidation to rising health care costs. That, in turn, has driven up the cost of health insurance plans for many small businesses and nonprofits in Connecticut, who are increasingly struggling to offer health care benefits as rates rise each year — often by double digits.

Research has also shown that vertical integration, where hospital systems buy up smaller practices, drives up costs for patients in two ways. First, larger hospital systems are able to negotiate higher rates with insurance companies than private practices for the same level of care. So when a practice gets acquired by a hospital system, its prices go up.

Second, small practices that have become part of a larger health system are more likely to send their patients to hospitals within the system for follow-up services. While convenient — the patient’s records stay within the system — the larger system has more power to set higher prices, which can cost the patient more.

Lawsuit challenges Hartford HealthCare’s acquisitions as ‘anti-competitive’

Saint Francis Hospital, owned by Trinity Health of New England, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Hartford HealthCare pushed it out of the market by buying up doctors’ practices and used certain clauses in its contracts with insurers that drove up health care prices and insurance premiums by limiting options for consumers.

Hartford HealthCare said its behavior does not qualify as “anti-competitive,” as the lawsuit claims.

In a motion to dismiss the case, Hartford HealthCare’s lawyers argued that Saint Francis should simply “compete harder to recruit and retain physicians.”

During this year’s Connecticut General Assembly session, a bill aimed at rooting out some of the same anti-competitive practices alleged in the lawsuit stalled."
Here are the Trump properties at the center of the New York attorney general’s lawsuit against the former President and his family,"CNN —

New York Attorney General Letitia James on Wednesday filed a civil fraud lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, three of his children and his business.

In more than 200 pages, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former President used to enrich himself, and that the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the notable properties mentioned in the lawsuit:

1. Mar-a-Lago

The New York attorney general’s lawsuit alleges Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida was valued “as high as $739 million based on the false premise that it was unrestricted property and could be developed and sold for residential use,” and continues, “in reality, the club generated annual revenues of less than $25 million and should have been valued at closer to $75 million.”

2. Trump Tower

James said that Trump inflated the square footage of his Trump Tower triplex apartment in order to misrepresent the value at over $300 million. “Mr. Trump represented that his apartments spanned more than 30,000 square feet, which was the basis for valuing the apartment. In reality, the apartment had an area of less than 11,000 square feet, something that Mr. Trump was well aware of,” James said. “Based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment in 2015, in 2016, was $327 million. To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount.”

3. Trump Park Avenue

Trump Park Avenue was appraised in 2010 to be worth approximately $72.5 million, according to the lawsuit. But Trump’s company claimed in subsequent financial statements that the property was worth roughly $292 million, according to the lawsuit. The property near Central Park includes high-end residential units, commercial spaces and storage spaces.

The lawsuit from James accuses former President Donald Trump of using allegedly doctored financial statements in his and Ivanka Trump’s personal pursuit to open a luxury hotel in Washington, DC, in the years before he ran for the presidency. It became a hub for his supporters and close contacts, and bookings grew because of the connection to the sitting president.

5. Trump International Hotel and Tower — Las Vegas, Nevada

The Trump hotel in Las Vegas – a hotel condominium of which Trump owns half – had misleading financial statements between 2013 and 2021, the suit alleges, due to income projections based on the sale of residential units that assumed prices much higher that what units were selling for, among other reasons.

6. 40 Wall Street

James also highlighted what she says happened with 40 Wall Street, a property in New York City’s financial district, which is referenced dozens of times in the lawsuit. Trump’s company got appraisals for the property in 2010 and 2012, which found that it was worth $200 million and $220 million respectively, according to the lawsuit. But Trump’s company repeatedly claimed that the property was worth a lot more in its official financial statements, according to the lawsuit.

7. Trump golf courses

The lawsuit argues the Trump Organization also used a variety of deceptive or inappropriate methods to inflate the value of Trump’s golf courses. For example, the organization added 30% to the value of various golf courses to account for a Trump “brand premium,” despite what the suit describes as rules against such practices. Trump claimed a club, Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, purchased for $5 million in 2012 jumped to a worth of a $62 million in 2013.

8. Licensing deals

Many of the Trump Organization’s ventures involve licensing deals, in which another party owns the property and pays Trump to use his brand. The lawsuit alleges that Trump’s business inflated the value of its overall licensing business by including “speculative and non-existent deals” between 2015 and 2018. Some of those speculative deals involved potential overseas arrangements. The suit argues that including them in the valuations in 2016 and 2017 was misleading because the Trump Organization purportedly stopped seeking foreign deals after Trump took office. The licensing deals’ value were further boosted by including deals between business entities owned by the Trump Organization, according to the suit. According to former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, “licensing was generally handled by Ivanka” and brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were well aware of the actual revenue derived from licensing in general, according to the lawsuit."
Opinion: California should better harness automated smart tech,"The following commentary was written by Amanda Myers Wisser, the policy and regulatory lead for Western states at WeaveGrid. WeaveGrid is the technology provider for the evPulse for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) pilot program. See our commentary guidelines for more information.

So far this year, California has been able to stave off rotating outages, despite a new peak demand record during the recent week-long heat wave that closely resembled the conditions that triggered rotating outages in August 2020. California has been preparing for extreme heat to reappear, and all of the planning work has paid off for addressing this near-term challenge. However, the state should continue to improve its response to and readiness for grid constraints resulting from extreme weather events. In particular, California can better utilize the suite of automated smart technologies at its fingertips to reduce electricity and attention demands from Californians.

Through ambitious climate goals, California has cultivated a strong climate tech ecosystem. For example, electric vehicles are now the state’s number one export and top talent from California’s famous Silicon Valley is flocking to climate-focused technology companies. As California decarbonizes its grid and electrifies its other economic sectors, there is ample opportunity for technology to play a role in creating a better grid. Automated smart technology can help orchestrate a sea of distributed energy resources (DERs) that can provide grid support without direct customer action.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are one important example of DERs that can support California’s grid. And with California’s new policy of 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035, EVs are a rapidly growing class of DERs that can provide grid benefits. EVs are unique as DERs because they provide significant demand flexibility due to the ratio of charging time to plug-in/park time. EVs are also a large load as compared to other DERs, particularly in a residential setting, so need to be managed carefully. Principally, EV charging can be scheduled to be “off-peak” and dynamically controlled, which is when the grid is not as constrained, typically avoiding the late afternoon to early evening stretch where supply and demand are closest.

A prime example of tying together automatic smart EV charging and resilience measures is the recently launched evPulse for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) pilot program, which not only automatically manages EV charging through the vehicles themselves (no costly charger required) but also sends Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) alerts to EV drivers in advance of PSPS events so EV drivers can charge up before power is potentially turned off. This pilot program boosts grid resilience by rewarding off-peak charging and boosts driver resilience by ensuring EV drivers are prepared in the case of wildfire conditions that threaten power availability.

evPulse for PG&E is just one example of a few automated technology programs in California, but on the whole, we need more policies and programs that allow customers to take a hands-off but climate- and cost-friendly approach to responding to grid challenges with the suite of power-consuming devices they may have.

Text messages that request shutting down power are effective but eventually may lead to consumer fatigue and given the importance of avoiding power outages, we must not resort to this method indefinitely. California is responding as quickly as it can to the climate and grid challenges it faces but the state needs to continue to move in the direction of relying on fewer manual responses from customers as customers electrify their homes and businesses. We simply cannot afford to make the transition to electrification burdensome.

As California does the hard but critical work of designing a climate-friendly future, it will undoubtedly continue to face challenges. The state should tap into its advanced technology industry to perform sophisticated grid functions rather than interrupting work and personal lives to keep our grid going through manual action. There are better ways to operate — let’s put our smart devices to work."

"DeSANTIS DEFIANT: Gov Shreds Vineyard Lawsuit, 'Migrants Treated Horribly by Biden'","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has responded after being hit with a class action lawsuit for flying 50 migrants to Martha’s Vineyard; the Sunshine State Gov commented during a news conference on Tuesday.

“Those migrants are being treated horribly by [President] Biden. They were hungry, homeless; they had no no opportunity at all,” the Republican governor said.

“It was volunteer, offered transport to sanctuary jurisdictions, because it’s our view that, one, the border should be secured, and we want to have Biden reinstitute policies like ‘Remain in Mexico’ and make sure that people aren’t overwhelming,” he continued.

“But short of that, if you believe in open borders, and this is sanctuary jurisdictions that should have to bear the brunt of the open borders. So that’s what we’re doing,” he said.

Information on the lawsuit from The New York Post:

The migrants, the suit contends, were duped into boarding planes in Texas with promises of jobs, gift cards and without being fully informed of their final destination.

“No human being should be used as a political pawn,” said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, the organization that filed the suit in Boston federal court. DeSantis questioned where the outrage is when migrants are being abused by the cartels, when migrants drown in the Rio Grande, when 50 migrants are found dead in an abandoned sweltering truck, or when huge amounts of fentanyl are being smuggled across the border.

DeSantis’ office also released an official statement and proof that all migrants signed a consent form. Town Hall contributor Julio Rosas shared details on Twitter.

“FL Gov. DeSantis’ office responds to the class action lawsuit that was filed in Massachusetts: ‘The immigrants were homeless, hungry, and abandoned – and these activists didn’t care about them then.’ Office also provided the consent form for flight to MA:”"
State employees likely to get 1K bonuses for COVID booster,"SEATTLE (AP) — Under a tentative deal Washington state employees would get $1,000 bonuses for receiving a COVID-19 booster shot.

The agreement between the state and the Washington Federation of State Employees also includes 4% pay raises in 2023, 3% pay raises in 2024 and a $1,000 retention bonus, The Seattle Times reported.

Gov. Jay Inslee announced this month that all pandemic emergency orders will end by Oct. 31, including state vaccine mandates for health care and education workers. But he has said a vaccine mandate will continue to be in effect for workers at most state agencies.

Most employees were required to have their initial series of vaccination by October of last year or be fired. New state employees have had to be vaccinated before their official start date.

“We want to have healthy people so people don’t miss work,” Inslee said earlier this month. “The vaccine still remains a very important thing.”

The Washington Federation of State Employees represents nearly 47,000 workers with roughly 35,000 state employees impacted by the tentative deal. The union said it would “help address widespread staffing shortages and workplace safety issues.”

The union called the deal, which still must be approved by both sides, the highest compensation package in the union’s history.

Inslee’s office declined to speak to the specifics of the tentative agreement announced by the union.

Offering incentives for boosters “reflects the feedback and recommendations we heard from employees and labor partners,” Jaime Smith, an Inslee spokesperson, said."

Police have arrested two more men in connection with the raising of pro-Pakistan slogans during a Muharram procession in Madhya Pradesh’s Shajapur district while a case was registered in Chhatarpur for an objectionable social media post, officials said on Tuesday.

“Madhya Pradesh Police has taken action in two cases related to raising slogans or making posts in favour of Pakistan in two cases in Madhya Pradesh’s Shajapur and Chhatarpur districts, state home minister Narottam Mishra told reporters.

He said those who raised slogans in support of Pakistan have been arrested.

“There is rule of law in Madhya Pradesh and only chanting of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ is allowed in the state,” Mishra said.

Chhatarpur Superintendent of Police Sachin Sharma said a case was registered after a complaint was filed by VHP and Bajrang Dal regarding an objectionable post with provocative slogans on social media. The content was allegedly posted from the user ID of a 17-year-old boy.

The case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and further investigation is underway, he said.

The action was taken by the police after Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal filed a complaint at Rajnagar police station, some 45 km away from the Chhatarpur district headquarters.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) office-bearer Anupam Gupta said a memorandum was submitted after ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans were posted on Instagram and Facebook and abusive words were used for India with an intention to disrupt communal harmony. In Shajapur district, police arrested two more men on Monday, more than a month after slogans were raised in the support of Pakistan during Muharram on August 10, Shajapur police station in-charge Premlata Khatri said, adding that the total of four persons have been arrested in the case so far after the video of the incident surfaced."
Update: County releases trove of emails between Communications Director and media members,"(Update, Sept. 23): Ithaca Alderperson Jeffrey Barken has published a reaction to the new emails released by the county and Tompkins County Legislature Chair Shawna Black’s comments at Tuesday’s meeting.

Barken first lodged allegations of undue media influence by Tompkins County Communications Director Dominick Recckio regarding the Reimagining Public Safety process. Black, in her first comments on the matter, called Barken’s claims “baseless and defamatory.” But Barken argued in his post on Thursday that the newly released emails, as detailed below, actually show “a pattern of improper influence and a series of problematic interactions between a placating editor and [their] censor,” referring to Tompkins Weekly editor Jessica Wickham and Recckio, though Barken continues not to name them directly, as he avoided in his original comments. He also did not expound on the multiple investigations he has said are underway into the matter.

Wickham has stated previously they never felt threatened by Recckio’s communications or concerns, but Barken insists that the emails are inappropriate and evidence of wrongdoing and paints the exchange as “chilling.” The full exchange can be read below, and Barken’s full statements are at the link above.

Original Story:

TOMPKINS COUNTY, N.Y.—Tompkins County’s response to allegations of media influencing continued Tuesday evening with the release of just over 800 PDFs that show about 20 months’ worth of e-mails between county Communications Director Dominick Recckio and members of the local media regarding Reimagining Public Safety.

Your government news is made possible with support from:

The allegations emerged two weeks ago when Alderperson Jeffrey Barken raised them during a privilege of the floor comment at an Ithaca Common Council meeting. Barken has been among the most vocal critics of the Reimagining Public Safety process on Common Council, and his speech seemed to have two main prongs: partially about press freedom, but moreso trying to assert a point about the strain that staffing issues at the Ithaca Police Department have put on emergency services in Ithaca and nearby.

County leadership has repeatedly stated that they have reviewed the matter and do not believe Recckio has done anything wrong.

Of the hundreds of e-mails released from the beginning of 2021 onward, which have been reviewed by The Ithaca Voice, only a few seem relevant to the issue at hand, indicative of the sweeping nature of the FOIL requests. The vast majority are press releases sent by Recckio on behalf of the county to various local news outlets, as well as several brief conversations about advertising sales, primarily with Tompkins Weekly. The emails only consist of communications with The Ithaca Voice, Tompkins Weekly and The Ithaca Times.

The relevant emails are four instances of Recckio “offering corrections” or “expressing concern” regarding stories, but nothing that seems to come close to threats or retaliation for coverage — which was the most significant portion of Barken’s allegations. The emails that have been released fall within the norm for a communications director; though there are other communications that have yet to be released.

Two emails of this kind were sent to Tompkins Weekly editor Jessica Wickham, one that spawned the initial controversy regarding an Aug. 3 story featuring Trumansburg Mayor Rordan Hart’s comments on the Reimagining Public Safety process in a story by Deidra Cross and the other regarding an April column by Cross profiling right-wing organizer/activist Rocco Lucente.

“I am sharing with you that I am concerned with this week’s ‘Trumansburg Connections’ column in Tompkins Weekly,” Recckio wrote. “This is peppered with lies, misleading statements and unfounded attacks on several topics, under the guise of featuring a harmless ‘activist and writer.'”

Recckio doesn’t directly ask for a change to the story, but lodges his objection to one inaccurate statement from Lucente about Ithaca intentionally dismantling its police department. Wickham said they understand, but it doesn’t appear that any changes were ultimately made to the article.

As previously reported, Wickham, whose pronouns are they/them, said they had never felt threatened by Recckio at any point in their working relationship. Cross’ freelance contract was terminated with Tompkins Weekly in the wake of the controversy, though Wickham has said that was in relation to Cross’ conduct, not the August column directly. Cross has said she plans to file a lawsuit over the situation.

Further, two corrections were offered to The Ithaca Voice, one regarding the number of police officers who have left IPD in the past few years and another regarding a July 2022 story about the Grassroots Festival failing to receive permits from the Tompkins County Health Department. Neither were accepted.

Developments have been limited since Barken’s speech on Sept. 7 , which can be read in full here. Recckio’s e-mails were released in bulk in response to FOIL requests made by several parties in the lead-up to Barken’s comments, including Barken himself, Ithaca Police Benevolent Association President Thomas Condzella, a California-based political consultant associated with the IPBA and an Ithaca business owner, Sequoia Valoy.

Tompkins County Deputy FOIL Officer Erin Murphy confirmed that there are more FOIL requests pending concerning Recckio’s emails, beyond what was fulfilled Tuesday night, meaning there are likely more emails to be released in the same manner in coming days or weeks.

Response to Barken’s comments during the actual Common Council meeting was rather muted, while Tompkins County Attorney Bill Troy announced the next day that, in the county’s view, Recckio had been cleared of any concern of wrongdoing.

Barken has publicly claimed that multiple investigations are underway into The Voice’s communications with Recckio, as well as all other local media outlets. Each public official asked by The Ithaca Voice said they were not conducting a further investigation, which includes Tompkins County District Attorney Matt Van Houten, County Administrator Lisa Holmes, Ithaca Acting Mayor Laura Lewis and Ithaca Alderperson George McGonigal (who is leading the Reimagining Public Safety Special Committee). The Ithaca Police Department did not immediately respond to The Voice’s inquiry.

Tompkins County Legislature Chair Shawna Black offered a forceful rebuke of Barken’s allegations at the legislature’s meeting Tuesday night, calling them “baseless and defamatory” while reasserting the county’s commitment to providing ample funding for law enforcement.

The matter has still not been discussed during the ongoing Ethics Advisory Board investigation into potential ethics violations during the Reimagining Public Safety formulation process."
"Hyundai, Kia Sued in Rash of Car Thefts","Owners of Kia and Hyundai cars filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday in federal court in Santa Ana alleging that the Orange County-based companies failed to install technology to thwart car thieves, leaving the vehicles vulnerable to a rash of thefts spurred by a video that went viral on social media.

The federal lawsuit was filed by Stephanie McQuarrie of Florida, Kaitlynn Marchione of Nevada, and Omar Becerra of Los Angeles County, who claimed their vehicles were stolen following a video on TikTok that they say exposed a vulnerability in the vehicles making them easier to steal. Kia has headquarters in Irvine and Hyundai is based in the United States out of Fountain Valley.

“This matter rises out of a blatant breach of public trust and a determination to put corporate profits over public safety,” the lawsuit alleges. “In an effort to maximize their return, defendants Kia America Inc. and Hyundai Motor America actively withheld vital security systems from countless vehicles for years. This has led to a severe defect that has already both endangered the public and drastically decreased the value of vehicles.”

The plaintiffs allege Hyundai executives considered adding “engine immobilizers” in the company’s vehicles to reduce thefts in 2007, as did Kia in 2009.

“Without the engine immobilizers, the cars can be easily hotwired and stolen, however Kia and Hyundai made no effort to warn their customers about the risk to their vehicles,” the lawsuit alleges.

Hyundai issued a statement saying the company was “concerned about the recent rise in auto thefts of certain Hyundai model vehicles. While all of our vehicles meet or exceed federal motor vehicle safety standards, unfortunately, our vehicles have been targeted in a coordinated effort on social media. Criminals are targeting our vehicles without engine immobilizers. Immobilizers became standard on all vehicles produced after November 1, 2021.

“In order to assist customers with earlier model year vehicles without an immobilizer, Hyundai has been working with and will continue to support local police departments to make steering wheel locks available for affected Hyundai owners. Additionally, Hyundai has identified a Firstech / Compustar security kit that targets the method of entry thieves are using to access these vehicles.

“Beginning October 1, 2022, this security kit will be available for purchase and installation at Hyundai dealerships and Compustar authorized installers across the country. Hyundai will provide additional details soon, and customers who have questions can always contact the Hyundai Consumer Assistance Center at 800-633-5151.”

Kia officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A TikTok “Kia Challenge” video posted in July 2022 went viral on the platform as well as on YouTube. In it, viewers are challenged to steal a Kia or Hyundai by “simply peeling back the steering column and inserting a standard USB cable,” allowing the security systems to be bypassed and igniting the engine, the lawsuit alleges.

“The Kia Challenge and the publicity regarding the defect has directly contributed to an enormous surge in vehicle thefts of the defective vehicles throughout the United States,” the lawsuit alleges. “In Los Angeles alone during 2022, Hyundai and Kia vehicles accounted for 20% of all vehicle thefts in the city, a sharp increase from only 13% the year prior. Similarly, the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin reported motor vehicle thefts had climbed 152%. In July of 2022, the city of Chicago, Illinois reported a 767% increase in Hyundai and Kia vehicle thefts.”"
